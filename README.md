My workflow is very chaotic (no clean layer system like lines/flats/shading) so I doubt source files will help much here. Hence to save space, I'll just upload the subtitle-less versions for if people want to do things with bitwam but the subtitles are annoying

How to read bitwam:
1) Download the [storyboards] directory
2) (once the story is complete) You should find:
* 0 - prologue
* 1 - on agency
* 2 - on responsibility
* 3 - on 'archy'
* 4 - final arc: back to reality
3) The above are arc folders, inside them will be scene folders (except prologue which just directly contains images), and inside those are images. Make sure the files are sorted by file name!
4) Read through in order
