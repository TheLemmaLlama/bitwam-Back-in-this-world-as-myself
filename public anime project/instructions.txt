just put what you've done in a single file or folder and chuck it in this folder. 
when asked to commit changes, check "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request."
sometimes you may have to upload things piecemeal since github doesn't let you upload more than 100 files at a time

the bitwamop1 folder is an example of OpenToonz source files of an incomplete animation uploaded into this folder.
(source files for other programs (animation or otherwise) may look different, but put it all in one project folder anyway if it's not already in a single file or folder)
